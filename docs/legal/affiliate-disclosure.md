# Affiliate Link Disclosure

## Summary

Some links on Atlasi may be affiliate links. When you click these links and make a purchase, Atlasi may earn a small commission at no additional cost to you.

## How It Works

- Links to travel partners (hotels, experiences, etc.) may include affiliate tracking
- We partner with services like Skimlinks to monetize applicable links
- Your experience and prices are not affected by affiliate links
- We use redirect URLs (`/o/{link_id}`) to track clicks for analytics

## What We Track

When you click an affiliate link, we may collect:
- The source page (trip share or list share)
- General geographic region (country-level)
- Whether the click came from a bot or real user
- The type of link resolution (partner affiliate, Skimlinks, or original URL)

We do NOT track:
- Your personal identity
- Precise location data
- Browsing history beyond the immediate click

## Our Commitment

- We never recommend places solely for affiliate revenue
- User-generated content (trips, lists) reflects genuine experiences
- Affiliate relationships don't influence search results or recommendations
- All affiliate links are clearly associated with user-shared content

## Partner Relationships

We may have direct affiliate relationships with:
- Booking.com
- TripAdvisor
- GetYourGuide
- Other travel and hospitality partners

For links without direct partnerships, we use Skimlinks to provide affiliate tracking when available.
